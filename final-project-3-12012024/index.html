            <h1>Welcome to Chian-Chian's Official Website</h1>
            <h2>Where Eastern arts and crafts are shared to the West.</h2>
            <p>Chian-Chian connects Eastern artists with Western art enthusiasts through in-person craft workshops, online art galleries, and mini art exhibitions. We believe that traditional Eastern arts such as calligraphy, natural dye, pottery and paper-making are valuable arts worth preserving and meaningful activities worth experiencing. 
            </p>

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>Chian-Chian was founded by a Taiwanese artist in 2017, with the hopes to expand Eastern traditional arts and crafts to Western customers. Through the process of making art, we can connect to other cultures and expand our hoirzons. Through interacting with Eastern artists, we can learn from them the essence of what makes their art calm and inspiriing.</p>

            <h3>Motto</h3>
            <p>Every glance leads to a grand view.</p>
            <p>We invite you to look around and appreciate thoughtful moments.</p>
